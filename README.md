Step 5: Bind label and subject with dataset

Step 6: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

Step 7: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names

Step 8: Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
